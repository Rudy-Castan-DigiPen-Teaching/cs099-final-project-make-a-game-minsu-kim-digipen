# High Concept

## Topic
```
As clearly and simply as you can, explain your game idea.
``` 

## Where I get idea
This game idea is come from shell game. \
In Korean "야바위". 

## Overall GamePlaying 
Get the what ⍟(Points) to use, and shake 3 cups. \
Inside the cup, there is a percent number like 100% \
If you choose, that percent number reveal and you get that percent of ⍟! \
(Related to what amount you decided to use.)

You can choose less than 10 Points. \
If you have less than 10 Points, you get the chance. 

You can go shop and buy upgrade, room background or other stuff!

## Summary
1. Play Shell game and earn ⍟.
2. Go to shop and buy something.
3. Play again.

That's all concept of the game.

# Theme

## Topic
```
Your game must adhere to the following theme:
Take One, Leave The Rest
Explain how your game idea works with the theme.
```

## How I get Idea
I thought take one, leave the rest is similar to Shell Game. \
Original Shell Game playing is like this.

There are 3 cups and ball
1. Put the ball inside the cup (Player can see where the ball in)
2. Shuffle 3 Cups (Player can't see inside the ball)
3. Player choose the Cup \
When Player choose cup that have ball, player wins. \
Else, host wins.

I change this to all cups have specific percent! \
There are MAX Percent (Basically, 200%) and all cups get random percent of that. \
Player choose one cup, and reveal the percent. \
And then, player get that percent of ⍟.

With this way, player choose one cup and other cups percents are all left out. \
So I thought it is related to the theme, and made this!
